# Perceptron

## Introduction
This program will train the perceptron on the training data, and then test on the testing data with etas of 0.1, 0.01 and 0.001 for 70 iterations each. This is the default mode. The eta and iteration can be reconfigured.

Output will be written to the console to let the user know what is happening, and the results will be written to `pcn.csv`

## Run
`sudo apt install python-numpy`

`python pcn.py`

## Note
The testing data will need to be decompressed before running the code.
